## Overview Tree and Forest
- Tree : entity with single domain
- Forest : a group of domain together
- Each trees is linked with trust relationship in a forest -> Enables domains to trust each other

## Trust relationship
- Facilitate communication between domain, enable resources access, enable authentication 
- can be one-way or two-way
- all domains within forest trust each other automatically, need to setup for other forest (viewable in New Trust Wizard)
